            Social Empowerment is one of the tripods which the Klub stands on. Since her
            inception, the KB Klub has achieved social empowerment amongst her members and
            the society at large. 
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the ways projects the KB Klub has empowered the society was through the
            KB Kup: King of the Kourt Tournament which was birthed in 2020 to bring
            individuals from all over to participate in an elite sports tournament in various
            sports. The end goal of this tournament was to put smiles on faces, which the
            KB Klub has done for over 50 years.
